Finally beautiful weather widgets for your site.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to easily add super clean weather widgets to your site. The design is based off the site: http://weatherrr.net/ and the widget changes colors based on the current temp.

Use the built in widget or add it somewhere else with this shortcode: (all settings shown)

`[awesome-weather location="Montreal" units="F" size="tall" override_title="MTL" forecast_days=2 hide_stats=true background=http://urltoanimage.jpg]`

Settings:

*   Location: Enter like Montreal, CA or just Montreal. You may need to try different variations to get the right city
*   Units: F (default) or C
*   Size: wide (default) or tall
*   Override Title: Change the title in the header bar to whatever, sometimes it pulls weather from a close city
*   Forecast Days: How many days to show in the forecast bar
*   Hide stats: Hide the text stats like humidity, wind, high and lows, etc
*   Background: URL to an image that will be used as the background of the entire widget

All weather data is provided by http://openweathermap.org and is cached for one hour.
